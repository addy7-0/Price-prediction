# Price-prediction

We have been provided descriptions of products on Amazon and Flipkart, including details like product title, ratings, reviews, and actual prices. Now we will predict discounted prices of the listed products based on their ratings and actual prices.
We will solve this problem by using the concepts of feature engineering and data cleaning, and then on then apply various ML algorithms to predict the prices.
